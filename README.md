# ZFBTool

ZFBTool is a utility specifically designed for the Data Frog SF2000 arcade system. It provides a user-friendly way to create .zfb files by pairing custom thumbnail images with game ROMs. It includes features for single-file processing and bulk processing from a selected folder. ZFBTool is a great tool for enhancing the SF2000 user experience by personalizing your game library.

## Features

- Easily create .zfb files for your arcade ROMs
- Add custom thumbnail images for each ROM
- Single file and bulk processing capabilities

## Required Python Packages

- tkinter
- PIL

You can install these packages using pip:

```
pip install tkinter Pillow
```

## How to Use

1. Download [`ZFBTool-v1.1-python.zip`](https://github.com/Dteyn/ZFBTool/releases/download/v1.1/ZFBTool-v1.1-py.zip) and extract anywhere.
2. Ensure you have Python and the necessary packages installed.
3. Run the `ZFBTool.pyw` file, and you will see the GUI.
4. In the GUI, you can either create a .zfb file from a single ROM or choose to compress an entire folder of ROMs.
    - For a single ROM, input your PNG file and the name of your ROM file. Then click "Create ZFB File".
    - For multiple ROMs, go to File > Compress Entire Folder, and select the folder containing your PNG and ROM files. You will then be prompted to select an output folder.
    - When compressing multiple ROMs, your .PNG and .ZIP filenames must be the same.
    - After .ZFB files are created, you can rename them to change the title of the ROMs in the Arcade menu
5. After building the .zfb files, they should be moved into the following folders:
   - ZFB files: `\ARCADE\`
   - ROM files: `\ARCADE\bin`
6. Run [frogtool](https://github.com/tzlion/frogtool) to rebuild the game list

Please note that the thumbnail images must be in PNG format.


## Renaming .ZFB Files

As of [version 1.1](https://github.com/Dteyn/ZFBTool/releases/tag/v1.1), ZFBTool now supports renaming of .zfb files based on the data from the [clrmamepro .dat files] created by `adcockm` (https://github.com/vonmillhausen/sf2000/tree/main/arcade). Included are several .txt files:

### ALL-INFO:
Files: [`fullset-romnames-all-info.txt`](https://github.com/Dteyn/ZFBTool/blob/master/romnames/fullset-romnames-all-info.txt) and [`playable-romnames-all-info.txt`](https://github.com/Dteyn/ZFBTool/blob/master/romnames/playable-romnames-all-info.txt)

Entire description from clrmamepro data, with names sanitized for Windows filenames (ie: slashes converted to dashes, etc).

### REGION-FULL:
Files: [`fullset-romnames-region-full.txt`](https://github.com/Dteyn/ZFBTool/blob/master/romnames/fullset-romnames-region-full.txt) and [`playable-romnames-region-full.txt`](https://github.com/Dteyn/ZFBTool/blob/master/romnames/playable-romnames-region-full.txt)

Description from clrmamepro data with full region and set info. Anything after "/" (typically Japanese name) removed for brevity

### REGION-SHORT:
Files: [`fullset-romnames-region-short.txt`](https://github.com/Dteyn/ZFBTool/blob/master/romnames/fullset-romnames-region-short.txt) and [`playable-romnames-region-short.txt`](https://github.com/Dteyn/ZFBTool/blob/master/romnames/playable-romnames-region-short.txt)

Shortened region and set info, ex: (J) instead of (Japan), [p] [B] to denote prototype/bootleg, (copy 1) etc. used for copies

### NO-INFO:
Files: [`fullset-romnames-no-info.txt`](https://github.com/Dteyn/ZFBTool/blob/master/romnames/fullset-romnames-no-info.txt) and [`playable-romnames-no-info.txt`](https://github.com/Dteyn/ZFBTool/blob/master/romnames/playable-romnames-no-info.txt)

Only the name of the short game with no other information (except Gun.Smoke and Varth in playable set, to avoid duplicate filenames)
WARNING: Use recommended only with the PLAYABLE set. FULL SET has many filename conflicts and is provided for reference only. 

## Advanced Users

Here are a few scripts for advanced users, or for implementing into your own scripts.

## .ZFB File Format

[based on tzlion's description here](https://github.com/tzlion/frogtool#technical-details)

The `.zfb` files used by the Data Frog SF2000 are custom files that include a thumbnail image and references to a ROM file. Here's a brief overview of how these files are structured:

- The first 0xEA00 bytes: This portion is reserved for a thumbnail image in RGB565 RAW format with dimensions of 144x208px.

- The following bytes: This portion contains the actual filename of the ROM in the "bin" folder, preceded by four `00` bytes and followed by two further `00` bytes.

It's important to note that .zfb files for arcade games don't contain the actual game ROM, they only reference to it.
